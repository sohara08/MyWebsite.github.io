									<h3>About my Fall Classes</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>Managerial Finance</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The purpose of MG410 is to provide Management Majors with the basic principles of managerial finance, and then to apply these principles in the context of managerial decision-making. Specifically, this course will cover: the fundamentals of the time value of money; the meaning and measurement of risk and return; valuation techniques for stocks and bonds; and standard techniques for financial analysis, to include capital budgeting, discounted cash flow valuation, and weighted average cost of capital. Cadets will leave this course with a solid understanding of how financial managers at the corporate level balance risk and return, and thus manage everyday financial decision-making.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Database Systems</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>This course addresses the analysis, design implementation, and management of relational databases. Structured query language (SQL) is covered in depth along with standard problem domain and data modeling techniques. Implementation techniques and considerations are discussed and practiced extensively. Key concepts include analysis and design using a standardized notation, data model to logical schema conversion techniques, normalization, data security, client-server architectures and web-based access to database systems. Students are exposed to user and privilege management, database backup and recovery, and security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Badminton/Pickleball</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>This is a 19 lesson course featuring nine lessons of Pickleball and ten lessons of Badminton. Pickleball is a sport played by two, three, or four people. Pickleball uses a wooden paddle and whiffleball and is very similar to tennis. The course focus is on the rules of play and basic skill development of service and service return, forehand and backhand drives, volley and half-volley, drop shot, lob, and overhead smash. Additional instruction in basic offensive/defensive strategy and tactics is provided. Badminton is a sport played by two, three, or four people on the same size court as pickleball. Badminton uses a lightweight strung racquet and shuttlecock (birdie). The course focus is also on the rules of play and basic skill development of service and service return, forehand, backhand, drop shot, lob, and overhead smash. Offensive/defensive strategy and tactics are discussed.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Constitutional and Military Law</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>This course studies the United States Constitution and Military Law. Cadets will acquire information and skills in order to recognize and resolve constitutional and legal problems. The course provides analytical models for dealing with problems regarding societal and military order. Finally, the course seeks to enable the cadet to make an intelligent commitment to the values and preferences embodied in the Constitution and our system of military and civilian law. Examples from military law are used to model fundamental principles examined in the course. Significant court decisions are explored to support the course goals. Specific substantive areas include: separation of powers, judicial review, war powers, the law of armed conflict, equal protection, privacy, individual rights, searches and inspections, military justice processes, and military criminal law.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Cyber Security Engineering</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The focus for this course is to design, build and test secure networked computer systems. Topics covered include operating system and network security, secure network architecture, and offensive and defensive information operations. Practical exercises that give students hands-on experience with current network security tools and techniques complement a series of laboratory exercises that have small groups of cadets secure their own small network. In a culminating exercise, cadets design, build and test defensive measures to protect a production network from intrusions.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Natural Language Processing</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>This course provides an in-depth study of a special topic in mathematics not offered elsewhere in the USMA curriculum. Course content will be based on the special expertise of the visiting professor or a senior mathematical science faculty member.</p>
