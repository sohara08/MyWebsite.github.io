I say that also as a cat owner, a fellow cat owner.\"Walz added: \"That was eloquent, and it was clear, and that\\'s the type of courage we need in America to stand up.\"Shortly after Swift\\'s endorsement, Trump popped up for a surprise appearance in the debate spin room.When questioned about Swift\\'s Harris endorsement, Trump said he had \"no idea\" about it.Even before the endorsement, Swift\\'s fans were fired up. A grassroots group dubbed Swifties for Kamala — with over 60,000 followers on X — had formed to mobilize support for the Democratic ticket, complete with friendship-bracelet activism.In 2020, Swift endorsed Joe Biden and accused Trump of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency.\"She did not make any public statements about the 2016 election but began speaking up about politics in 2018. Her disdain for Marsha Blackburn, who later won her Tennessee US Senate election, led Swift to get more vocal about her views. In her documentary \"Miss Americana,\" Swift\\'s father, Scott, expressed fears over Swift\\'s safety if she spoke out about the election, but she pressed on anyway.In August, Trump posted AI-generated images of Swift urging people to vote for him on Truth Social.Swift referenced the AI images in her lengthy endorsement message.\"It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\" she wrote. \"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\"The superstar\\'s endorsement came as some of her fans questioned her closeness to Brittany Mahomes, the wife of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Swift has become close to the Mahomeses since she began dating the Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Brittany Mahomes recently liked a post on Trump\\'s Instagram account and was praised by him.When Fox Business asked Trump about legal risks related to the AI Swift posts, he said the images were \"made up by other people\" and called artificial intelligence \"very dangerous.\"Many Democrats had been champing at the bit for a Swift endorsement given her unique cultural sway and loyal fandom.There was also some buzz that she might appear at the Democratic National Convention in August, which ultimately didn\\'t happen.Other celebrities backing Harris and Walz include Stevie Wonder, Oprah Winfrey, The Chicks, John Legend, and Charli XCX.Jump to',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump doesn\\'t like Taylor Swift. At all.The former president didn\\'t mince words on Sunday when he mentioned Swift in a Truth Social post.\"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" he wrote.Swift became the target of Trump\\'s contempt when she publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. The billionaire pop star shared her stance in an Instagram post that had racked up 11 million likes by Sunday.\"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,\" Swift wrote.Scoring an endorsement from Swift likely isn\\'t the benchmark to secure an election win, but her influence is undeniable.Swift also shared a link to Vote.gov with her 284 million Instagram followers when she endorsed Harris, which resulted in over 400,000 people visiting the website in 24 hours.Trump downplayed the endorsement during an interview with Fox & Friends the next day, saying he\\'s \"not a Taylor Swift fan.\"\"She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she\\'ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,\" he added.Even if Trump isn\\'t a Swiftie, he\\'s vied for her attention and influence several times during his campaign.Trump claimed in February that he\\'s made Swift \"so much money\" and that her potential endorsement of President Joe Biden, who left the race in July, would be \"disloyal.\"\"I signed and was responsible for the Music Modernization Act for Taylor Swift and all other Musical Artists. Joe Biden didn\\'t do anything for Taylor, and never will,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"There\\'s no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money.\"Trump spoke about Swift again in June, questioning why she would vote for Biden, according to former CNN reporter Melanie Zanona. \"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said. \"He doesn\\'t know how to get off a stage.\"That month, an excerpt from \"Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass\" that was obtained by Variety said Trump called Swift \"beautiful\" and expressed shock she was liberal.In August, Trump shared AI-generated images to Truth Social that showed Swift and her fans supporting his campaign.\"I accept!\" he wrote.He tried to distance himself from the images during an interview on Fox Business but has not deleted them from his Truth Social account.Trump\\'s team has gotten on the Swift train, too. His campaign\\'s official X account announced last week that it was selling t-shirts inspired by Swift\\'s Eras Tour merchandise.But now that Swift has endorsed Harris, it seems Trump and his team have turned cold.The official Trump War Room X account shared a screenshot purportedly showing a poll in which 87% of respondents said Swift\\'s endorsement of Harris \"makes no difference\" in their vote.Swift again encouraged Americans to vote during her acceptance speech at this year\\'s MTV Video Music Awards.\"This is a fan-voted award, and you voted for this, and I appreciate it so much,\" she said. \"And if you are over 18, please register to vote for something else that\\'s very important: our presidential election.\"Representatives for Trump and Swift did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Jump to',\n",
       " 'Swift called herself a \"childless cat lady\" in the endorsement post.On the heels of Tuesday night\\'s presidential debate, Taylor Swift announced she is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\"Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven\\'t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most,\" Swift wrote in an Instagram post. \"As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.\"Swift said she would be voting for Harris \"because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"\"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,\" she said.Swift also said she was \"so heartened and impressed\" by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz being chosen as Harris\\' running mate, adding that he \"has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman\\'s right to her own body for decades.\"Swift criticized former President Donald Trump for recently sharing an AI-generated image -- which falsely claimed Swift was supporting him for president -- on social media, saying it had \"conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.\"\"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,\" she said. \"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\"\"I\\'ve done my research, and I\\'ve made my choice,\" she wrote. \"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\"Swift concluded her post by encouraging fans to register to vote and to vote early if they can, saying she would share links in her Instagram story on how to do so.She signed off her post with her name and \"Childless Cat Lady\" -- a callback to a 2021 comment from Sen. JD Vance, in which he smeared Harris and other Democrats for not having biological children, and a reference to her owning three cats.Swift had long been expected to endorse Harris. The once publicly apolitical singer became more vocal about her views in recent years and endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020.She also came out strongly against Trump in 2020, accusing him of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism\" and putting \"millions of Americans\\' lives at risk in an effort to hold on to power.\"And Swift\\'s political seal of approval could prove powerful. After she made Instagram posts in 2018 and 2023 encouraging fans to register to vote, tens of thousands of people did just that.Shortly after news of Swift\\'s endorsement broke, Walz told MSNBC\\'s Rachel Maddow he was “incredibly grateful” for her endorsement.“I say that also as a cat owner -- a fellow cat owner,” Walz added.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events',\n",
       " 'Find anything you save across the site in your account Find anything you save across the site in your account Taylor Swift has made a rare political endorsement, telling the world that she will be voting for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the U.S. presidential election. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” Swift wrote. “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.” Find Swift’s full statement below.Swift made her statement after tonight’s presidential debate between Harris and former President Donald J. Trump. It also arrives after months of speculation about whether she would formally throw her support behind a presidential candidate, as Swift has rarely endorsed specific candidates. In 2018, she threw her support behind two Democratic candidates in Tennessee. (“I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country,” she wrote at the time.) And, ahead of the 2020 presidential election, she told V that she would be voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. In addition, Swift has supported various causes and legislation, such as the Equality Act and the March for Our Lives.In her statement tonight, Swift referenced Trump’s false claims that she had endorsed him for president. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,” she wrote. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Swift shared her endorsement on her Instagram account, where she has over 283 million followers. She pointedly posted her message with a photo of herself and one of her beloved cats. During tonight’s debate, Trump made false claims about immigrants in Ohio eating pet cats and dogs, and his Republican running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has tried to denigrate Harris and other women by calling them “childless cat ladies.” Reclaiming the phrase, Swift, who has no children and several pet cats, signed her note, “Taylor Swift Childless Cat Lady.”According to The New York Times, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, responded to Swift’s endorsement of Harris by calling it “more evidence that the Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy elite.”Taylor Swift:Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight.

Late Tuesday night after the first debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Swift publicly threw her support behind Harris and her running mate Tim Walz.“I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” Swift wrote in a statement on her Instagram. “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”The presidential candidates from both parties have long clamored for Taylor Swift’s blessing, dating back to when Joe Biden was still in the race. Donald Trump even went so far as to “accept” a clearly fake AI-generated endorsement from Swift and her fans. Swift said that gesture informed her decision to go public with an endorsement: “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Here’s Swift’s full statement, which also alludes to Trump running mate J.D.

       " 'Taylor Swift, a self-declared \"childless cat lady,\" has endorsed Kamala Harris for president of the ... [+] United States. (Photo by SAUL LOEB and ANDRE DIAS NOBRE / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEBANDRE DIAS NOBRE/AFP via Getty Images)There has been a significant shake-up in the 2024 race for the White House—and not just because of the less-than-stellar performance by former President Donald Trump during Tuesday evening\\'s debate. Though political pundits spent the late hours of Tuesday and much of Wednesday morning discussing statements made by Trump and rival Vice President Kamala Harris during their first—and likely only—presidential debate in this year\\'s election cycle, pop singer Taylor Swift also made headlines.The singer, who is taking a brief break from her global tour, endorsed Harris via a post on Instagram, writing, \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.\"The pop superstar said she was \"sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,\" while adding that she was recently made aware of AI being used to \"falsely\" endorse the former president.\"I\\'m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,\" Swift added in her Instagram post, and she called upon her followers to vote—but didn\\'t actually call upon them to vote for Harris.\"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,\" she suggested. \"I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!\"In a call-in to \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning, Trump responded that he wasn\\'t surprised by Swift\\'s decision to endorse Harris, labeled her \"a very liberal person,\" and suggested, \"She\\'ll probably pay a price for it […] in the marketplace.\"Swift\\'s endorsement of Harris shouldn\\'t be seen as surprising, as she had backed Joe Biden and Harris in 2020, but her superstar status has only increased in the past four years. Thus the impact it could have on the election shouldn\\'t be dismissed, especially as it could entice younger voters to head to the polls.\"This is a real case study in terms of a celebrity impacting an election,\" explained Scott Talan, senior professorial lecturer in public communications at American University. \"She laid out in several paragraphs what led to her endorsement. The fact that it was on Instagram is noteworthy as it is the medium that young people use. It was an A+ job in impact and potential success.\"Swift\\'s post also allowed her to respond directly to the false claims from last month that she had endorsed Trump. Her post set the record straight to her fans while highlighting the danger not to believe everything you read on the platforms.\"Social media are marketing platforms now and not necessarily based on personal thought or opinion. The amount of misinformation spreads like wildfire because of the sheer size of those communities. They do not encourage impact, but actually the contrary and Gen Z are savvy to authenticity. It was powerful for Taylor to officially post her intentions, as she said, to be very transparent and fight misinformation with the truth,\" said Claire Wright, CEO and co-founder of social media utility app BUDDY.\"Taylor has her comments turned off, most likely to prevent everyone, including herself, from experiencing toxic comments—sadly what the culture of social media use has become,\" suggested Wright.In many ways, Swift\\'s endorsement via Instagram could be critical for Harris simply because of her massive following. Even if not all \"Swifties\" are liberals, her message was still about the importance of voting—and serves as a reminder of MTV\\'s Rock the Vote campaign from the 1990s.\"The key to the 2024 Presidential election is getting new voters out to the polls,\" said Linda Bloss-Baum, professorial lecturer in the Department of Management at American University\\'s Kogod School of Business.\"The biggest crop of \\'new\\' votes may come from the younger electorate that has not actively participated in past elections,\" added Bloss-Baum, who also said many students have been asking how to register to vote and get involved in a campaign. \"These voters are proud \\'Swifties.\\'\"The power of celebrity can\\'t be dismissed, as Bloss-Baum further noted that Swift sold 4.35 million tickets last year for the first U.S. leg of her Eras tour.\"The way she relates to her fans through her music, social media, and personal anecdotes creates a sense of intimacy and understanding,\" said Bloss-Baum. \"Taylor Swift\\'s deep connection with an entire generation surpasses that of any artist in my lifetime. The millions of Instagram likes that Taylor\\'s post received within mere minutes after the Presidential debate shows how quickly her fans stand ready to support her, and by extension, Kamala Harris. If a mere fraction of those \\'likes\\' turn into \\'votes\\' for Kamala Harris, it could seriously impact the outcome of the election in November.\"Yet, it should be remembered too that Trump is also more celebrity than a politician.\"If he wasn\\'t a reality TV star, he wouldn\\'t be president,\" added Talan.The difference is that Trump\\'s celebrity status may have helped win him the White House in 2016, but it fell short in 2020, and might not put him over the top in 2024. By comparison, Swift is at the top of her game.\"She has one of the biggest fan bases around, and you tie this into more and more young voters being politically motivated, while her fans are mainly fans are female with abortion being a central campaign issue,\" said Talan. \"There isn\\'t another celebrity on the other side of the political spectrum that has the reach of Swift.\"One Community.

Tim Walz as her running mate due to his support for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and \"a woman\\'s right to her own body.\"\\xa0The pop star also appeared to troll the Republican ticket by signing \"Childless Cat Lady\" below her name — echoing a phrase Trump\\'s running mate, JD Vance, has faced blowback over using in a 2021 interview, when he said the country was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.\" Vance later said he was being sarcastic. \\xa0The megastar said she had been made aware of recent AI-generated images Trump had promoted that falsely suggested she had endorsed him, adding that the incident \"brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\"\\xa0Swift said she watched the debate on Tuesday night and urged her fans to research the candidates and issues, while closing her statement by explaining that she had done her research and \"made my choice.\"\"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,\" Swift said.\\xa0Swift\\'s possible endorsement has been the subject of intense debate in the political sphere. Earlier in Swift\\'s career, she had stayed out of political endorsements, but in 2018, she issued her first endorsement, for Democratic Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen in the Senate race against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn, who won the race. In the 2020 election, she backed President Biden. And at this year\\'s Democratic National Convention, rumors swirled that Swift or Beyoncé would make an appearance to back the new Democratic nominee, though neither did so.Harris\\' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was told about Swift\\'s endorsement as he was being interviewed on MSNBC after the debate and said he was \"incredibly grateful,\" adding, \"This would be your opportunity, Swifties — KamalaHarris.com, get on over there, give us a hand, get things going.\"Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams said Swift\\'s announcement came as a surprise.\\xa0\"We\\'re very very proud to have her endorsement. The vice president obviously respects her a lot,\" he said. \"...Obviously Taylor Swift speaks to a huge audience of people in this country and frankly around the world, who find her story and songwriting resonant to them. The fact she did it tonight, she said it in her post, it speaks to the commanding nature of the performance the vice president had on the debate stage.\"Asked if Swift would hit the campaign trail, he said, \"We would be happy for Taylor Swift to do whatever she would like to do in this campaign.\"In an interview on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump responded to Swift\\'s announcement by saying he prefers the endorsement he got from Patrick Mahomes\\' wife Brittany. \"I was not a Taylor Swift fan,\" Trump said. He called her a \"very liberal person\" and said she will \"pay the price for it in the marketplace.\"Prominent Republicans and Democrats weighed in on the endorsement in the spin room following the debate, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who told reporters that Swift is \"a cultural icon,\" while encouraging Trump not to \"disparage that endorsement.\"Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and close ally to Trump, quipped, \"I love when liberals make our art and our music and conservatives make our law and our policy.\"\\n\\nAaron Navarro, \\n                                                  \\n                      Shawna Mizelle and \\n                                                  \\n                      Jacob Rosen\\n                  \\n        contributed to this report. \\n      \\nKaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Trump himself shared the deepfakes with the caption \"I accept!\" on his social platform Truth Social.\"It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\" Swift said in her post.\"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\"Swift is widely seen as the biggest and most influential pop star in the world right now and her support this campaign has been the subject of intense speculation, with Trump himself bringing it up on social media.In February, Trump wrote that he was \"responsible for the Music Modernisation Act for Taylor Swift\" and that President Joe Biden \"didn\\'t do anything for Taylor\".\"There\\'s no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money,\" he wrote.\"Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis [Kelce], even though he may be a liberal, and probably can\\'t stand me!\"At the time, a conspiracy theory accusing Swift and Kelce of faking their relationship as part of a plot to bring Trump down was swirling online.Taylor Swift is at the centre of a far-right conspiracy theory that claims the singer is part of an elaborate plot to rig football games and deliver Joe Biden the presidency. Here\\'s how it unfolded.The singer has already proved she can have a major impact on politics.In March 2023, she posted a short message on Instagram encouraging her then 272 million followers to register to vote.Following the post, the website she directed her fans to — the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org — recorded more than 35,000 registrations, according to the organisation.The singer said she was heartened and impressed by Harris\\'s selection of running mate Tim Walz who she said \"has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman\\'s right to her own body for decades\".Tim Walz was on live TV as Swift posted her endorsement on Instagram, and MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow read it out to him.\\xa0\"I\\'m incredibly grateful first of all to Taylor Swift as a fellow cat owner,\" he said.\\xa0\"That was eloquent, and it was clear, and that is the type of courage we need in America to stand up.\\xa0\"This would be the opportunity Swifties, Kamala Harris.com.\"Get on over there, give us a hand, get things going.\"Taylor Swift, whose Eras Tour has sold out in cities across the world, is widely seen as the biggest and most influential pop star in the world right now. (AP: File)Swift urged voters to do their research in the lead up to the election.\"I\\'ve done my research, and I\\'ve made my choice.\"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\"She signed off as \"Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady\" which was a reference to comments made by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats \"a bunch of childless cat ladies\".\\xa0Today is not the first time Swift has endorsed a presidential candidate.In the last debate of this election, Joe Biden saw his 2024 ambitions evaporate. This time, his deputy Kamala Harris went in determined to ruffle Donald Trump\\'s feathers. These were the big moments.She threw her support behind Joe Biden in 2020, directly addressing Trump in a social media post saying: \"We will vote you out in November.\"Swift\\'s started her career in country music when she was just a teenager, and in her early years of fame she was decidedly apolitical.The turning point is chronicled in her 2020 documentary, Miss Americana.The documentary shows Swift and her team debating her decision to endorse two Democrats who were running for office from Tennessee in the 2018 midterm elections, with Swift\\'s father worrying that a political position could ruin her career.\"I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country,\" Swift wrote in a post on Instagram at the time.Then-president Trump reacted by telling reporters: \"Let\\'s say that I like Taylor\\'s music about 25 per cent less now, OK?\"Lauren Rosewarne from the University of Melbourne said while Swift has encouraged voter enrolment in the past, she may not sway the demographic Harris needs to attract.\"Whether Swift\\'s endorsement changes voter intentions is difficult to determine,\" Dr Rosewarne said.\\xa0\"We do however, need to keep in mind that Kamala Harris\\'s supporter base already skews young and female — which is a similar fan base to Swift\\'s.\"Whether therefore, her endorsement has the capacity to shift the views of people who weren\\'t already in the Harris camp is yet to be determined. \\xa0\"Harris\\'s main problem lies with male voters: I\\'m not sure Swift moves them.\"Topic:Unrest, Conflict and WarTopic:Unrest, Conflict and WarAnalysis by David SpeersTopic:WarTopic:Child AbuseTopic:State and Territory ParliamentAnalysis by David SpeersTopic:Child AbuseElectionsGovernment and PoliticsMusic (Arts and Entertainment)US ElectionsUnited StatesWorld PoliticsTopic:Unrest, Conflict and WarTopic:Unrest, Conflict and WarAnalysis by David SpeersTopic:WarTopic:Child AbuseTopic:Government and PoliticsTopic:Law, Crime and JusticeTopic:Agricultural Weed ControlTopic:PoliceWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\tBy Author Kay D. Rhodes at\\n\\t\\t\\tSep 11, 2024 • Category Taylor Swift A very bad Tuesday night for Donald Trump turned truly awful, even for his running mate JD Vance!Minutes after the convicted felon was lambasted in a debate by Vice President Kamala Harris — at one point Trump was reduced to claiming that “people on TV” were saying immigrants had been eating pets — the following finally happened:Taylor Swift endorsed Harris for President of the United States.Mere seconds after Kamala left her podium during the first Presidential debate, Taylor sent a message out to her Swifties:“Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight,” wrote the superstar to open a lengthy social media statement. “If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. “As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.”Swift then referenced the lame and desperate attempt by Trump to pretend a few weeks ago as if he had her support.“Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,” the artist continued.“It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Taylor then dropped the truth bomb that Trump has been fearing for ages might soon explode.This is what Swift wrote:I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Swift famously stayed out of politics until October 2018 when she endorsed a number of Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee.Amid the highest-grossing tour in music history, with a fanbase as passionate as any celebrity has ever enjoyed, many onlookers have been wondering whether Swift would get involved in the 2024 Presidential Election.We now have our answer.“I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice,” she concluded. “Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. “I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.”Swift, an avid lover of felines, even signed her message from a “Childless Cat Lady,” citing the words used by Trump’s running mate, J.D Vance, in describing the type of people he believes are ruining this country.No one does a subtle, yet powerful burn quite like Tay Tay. Following the debate, Kamala’s running mate and America’s favorite Mid-Western dad Tim Walz made the rounds on cable news to talk about her performance. While speaking with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, he was made aware of her endorsement live on the air. Walz put a hand on his chest and smiled wide as he took in the news. “I am incredibly grateful, first of all, to Taylor Swift. I say that also as a cat owner — a fellow cat owner,” he said, calling her message “eloquent” and “clear” and urging Swifties to “get on over” to Harris’s website.Walz -1, Vance -0BREAKING: Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president.Tim Walz reacts to the news LIVE on MSNBC pic.twitter.com/wACc6WzQ3kBut Tim wasn’t the only one asked about Taylor breaking her silence. Trump also made the rounds to some news organizations (coughFOXcough) and when he was asked about the endorsement he attempted to, pardon the pun, shake it off. But also true to form, he made the whole thing divisive, bringing in Brittany Mahomes to the chat.“Well, I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth. She’s a big Trump fan,” he said during an interview on “Fox & Friends”\\xa0 the next morning. “Brittany’s great. Brittany got a lot of news last week. She’s a big MAGA fan. That’s the one I like much better than Taylor Swift … the wife of the great quarterback — and he is a great quarterback. I think she’s terrific,” he said.He then dared to suggest that Taylor’s career would suffer by not endorsing him. “I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time. She couldn’t — you couldn’t possibly endorse [President] Biden. But she’s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,” he added.Yeah, sure Trump. SURE.

Minutes after the conclusion of Tuesday’s presidential debate, hosted on ABC and simulcast on every major news network, Taylor Swift took to Instagram to formally endorse former President Donald Trump‘s opponent. What follows is Swift’s full statement, which she shared with her 283 million Instagram followers:Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight.

Do they even do anything? Apparently, they did move the needle enough for one undecided voter: a Ms. Taylor Swift has endorsed Kamala Harris.” After his studio audience cheered in response, he added: “You know what this means? Taylor Swift and I were watching TV at the same time!”Over on CBS, Late Show host Stephen Colbert declared that Harris gave “one of the best debate performances I have ever seen, and there is nothing — absolutely nothing — that could have made tonight any better.” Then came Swift’s endorsement. “I stand corrected,” he said.Tuesday’s debate ran for more than 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks. There were no opening statements. Harris and Trump had two minutes to answer each question, with two additional minutes allowed for rebuttals and an extra minute for follow-ups. Each candidate’s microphone was muted when the other candidate spoke, and they were not permitted to ask each other questions.David Muir and Linsey Davis moderated the audience-free spectacle from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where they sought to ensure a civilized discussion. No topics or questions were shared with the candidates beforehand, and no props or pre-written notes were allowed on stage.After a coin flip to decide, Trump chose to deliver the last closing statement.

Now everyone can make their own decisions. She is such a shining star. Love her.In her VAST life span of wisdom.😂It doesn’t take much life span or wisdom to realize that one of the Candidates tried to use a mob to overturn an election and the other didn’t.According Nance’s logic, Trump , in his VAST life span and wisdom, should win the election. Forget policy. Forget that he literally said if he wins, we won’t have to vote again EVER.Taylor swift born 1989.\\nJD Vance born 1984.So that 5 years makes him qualified to run the country when Trump dies? I mean its likely to happen within the next 4 years, the dude is old, overweight and unhealthy.She is 34 years old and one of the most well-known people in the world through her own music and branding. What VAST life span of wisdom do you offer, ole’ Nance?Taylor Swift endorsed\\n       the right candidate,\\n         Kamala Harris!No, Kamala is the left candidate. Pay attention!Please.  Taylor Swift is so far removed from middle America. If anyone votes based on what she says they shouldn’t be allowed to vote.And as an AMERICAN CITIZEN, she has a right and responsibility to VOTE.  And to endorse anyone she chooses, And oh by the way, DONALD TRUMP LIVES IN A MANSION… not exactly middle America,Because the grifter “millionaire” candidate is so connected to middle class America. Please..If you actually looks carefully, what she says is DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.\\nHonestly, anyone who DOESN’T vote based on that advice shouldn’t be allowed to vote.But you know her fans are voting the way she doesMary ,I’m pretty sure that most people would rather vote based on what Taylor Swift says,  than by what you say!They shouldn’t vote for anyone based on what others say.  If they aren’t smart enough to do the homework and vote besed on THEIR knowledge, they shouldn’t vote at all.Hi, middle American speaking here – she’s making the right choice in her endorsement. I agree that people shouldn’t base their votes off of what celebrities say, but considering I fully support Harris and will be voting for her, it is always nice to get more public support of any sort for candidates like her.\\n.\\nBut thanks for acting like you speak for all of us who live here, really appreciate it.If anyone thinks an addled misogynistic convicted felon who tried to over thrown the government, that accuses people of eating cats and dog, that thinks JD Vance would be a good vice president, should allowed to seek higher offices, they shouldn’t be allowed to vote as they are so far removed from intelligent thought it’s frighteningFinally!Yes!!!Conservatives are shaking, crying, and sweating in the fetal position.You will be, too. six months from now if she wins.  You have no idea what medicare for all is even about…She lied when she said you don’t need approval. You need approval for everything and can wait a year for elective surgery. I’ve been on it for 7 years and have first hand experience. Be careful what you wish for.Look what you made her do… ;)“With love and hope,\\nTaylor Swift\\nChildless Cat Lady”\\n😹😹😹Taylor knows best.One more step forward.\\nWe are not going back.Donald Trump didn’t answer no questions that he c was asked he is doing his best to Kamala Harris look bad which made him look stupid she did an excellent job with the debateDonald Trump loves the poorly educated, so he’s right up your alley.And you didn’t seem to notice that Wilhemena is against the Trump, so how educated are you? Maybe stop and think before your next trolling.Reread this and then decide who looks stupid!!!!LOVE YOU SO MUCH TAYLOŔ AND I LOVE YOUR OUT FITS WITH THE STONES AND THE MATCHING RIENSTONE BOOTSGood! It’s about time she cleared up those rumors associated for the fake Taylor for Trump endorsement he tried to use.European here… question, why is this important that Taylor Swift is endorsing anyone? Isn’t she just a singer?It’s not. Free positive publicity for the Harris campaign today and then it fades away. Celebrity endorsements don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Everybody knew how she was voting as she’s made it abundantly clear in the past anyway.The idea is that she’s got the kind of influence that can inspire and encourage her young fanbase to get out and vote. Which terrifies the right, because the more young people in general get out and vote (and the more people as a whole who vote, the less likely it is for the GOP to win elections.It’s mostly important that she’s encouraging civic engagement and critical thinking about one’s vote, regardless of whom one actually casts a ballot for.Celebrity endorsements are important in that it helps to drive more voter turnout. Two-thirds of our voting eligible population voted in 2020 (highest in 120 years). The more people who vote, the better. It’s the best barometer there is to know what actually matters to the populace.It isn’t important to know who she endorses, but since the other side used AI to say she was endorsing him it is important to set the record straight. I am not a fan, not a hater either, but that was one well written, level headed post. Made me respect her a little. If it gets people to do their own research and register to vote then it is a great thing.She’s still besties with a hardcore MAGA supporter so…Who cares? If you can’t look past political differences when it comes to family/friends, that says more about you than anything.Yeah sorry I can’t look past someone supporting a terrorist sorry.So what? The Right has Kevin Sorbo. You know the guy who played Hercules in the 90s and uhhh that Walking Tall movie I think.WHY would anyone care who she’s voting for?  A rich person who obviously doesn’t worry about the price of food, gas, utilities, medical bills, prescription medications.  Another empty head celebrity who thinks she’s important to everyday people.You just described trump perfectly.  “A rich person who obviously doesn’t worry about the price of food, gas, utilities, medical bills, prescription medications. Another empty head celebrity who thinks HE’S important to everyday people.”In theory nobody should care who she is voting for. They should do their own research and make their own opinion. And in this case, I actually think Taylor would have preferred to stay out of it. However, it was Trump lying about her that made her step up and want to correct the lies. So blame him.Taylor Swift:  Who cares about your opinions or how you vote?  Not me.  I have a brain!Do you though?Honestly, if anybody watched Trump’s incoherent ramblings last night and thought that was good, I would not expect those people to make statements boasting their intelligence. It is alarming that there are people who are okay with all the garbage Trump said. So no Sue, I suggest you get your brain checkedThen why dd your guy proudly announce she endorsed him when the fake AI thing come out? Or does t only count when you agree with her?I’m glad she called out Trump’s use of AI to fake her endorsement. Our biggest enemy right now is misinformation and propaganda. She’s the perfect person to address it. Not just because of what Trump did but because bad actors have been using deepfakes to harass women. in all walks of life. That’s what Trump did to her so this is her revengeI noticed she just mentioned social issues. I guess when you can afford to gas your private jet and eat out at fancy restaurants the price of gas and groceries does not matter. Also a secure border doesn’t matter when you have security and lived in a gated community.Are you familiar with the term “irony”?As if the debate changed her mind.  She’s openly a progressive Democrat  and would never, ever have voted for TrumpDid she say the debate changed her mind???The majority of rich people…mostly celebrities…will support Harris. They do not worry about feeding their families or having enough money for rent and car payments. It’s a complete joke watching shows like the View with hosts making millions whose personal hate against Trump may result in the election of someone who will bankrupt my family and lead us to wars.I mean, when someone tries to overturn a democratic election and also supports policies that take away basic civil and human rights from anyone who isn’t a straight, white, Christian man, ,as Trump did/does, I would say that’s a perfectly valid reason to dislike them.Given Trump’s tax cut for the rich promise they are actually worth listening to because they are effectively recommending voting for someone who won’t provide a benefit to them. Under Trump they’d have more money. Also, Trump has literally never been poor or remotely middle class and all these people are commenting that Taylor Swift, who grew up on a Christmas tree farm, is out of touch? Seriously, how does the rhetoric get so twisted? Basic logic waved bye bye to so many Trump supporters it’s legitimately scary.😂 Does anyone even care what Taylor Swift thinks 😏🙄😝 just another ignorant leftist. Oh wait people do care what she thinks, all of her little swifty puppets 🤭Based on the way you use emojis, you seem to be in junior high. Maybe one day you’ll understand why you sound ridiculous.By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

       " '\\n\\n      Chloe Veltman\\n    \\n\\n                Pop superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Instagram on Tuesday.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Pedro Ugarte/AFP via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\nOn Tuesday night, Taylor Swift made a much-anticipated endorsement – she’s backing Vice President Harris for president. “She fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” Swift wrote on Instagram. “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”Last month, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reposted an AI-generated image of the pop star wearing an Uncle Sam outfit, in which he accepted her seeming endorsement of his campaign. The post appeared on the politician\\'s Truth Social network. (He\\'s since denied he knows anything about the images.)But Swift wrote that this incident conjured up her fears around AI, and spurred her to share her \"actual plans for this election as a voter.\" Back when Trump posted the AI image, we took a look at the history of celebrity endorsements and their effects. You can read that story here:Celebrity endorsements are as much a thing in politics as they are in consumer products.\"Celebrities draw increased engagement, increased attention, and they increase conversation,\" said Ashley Spillane, the author of a new study from Harvard’s Kennedy School on celebrity engagement in politics — focusing on civic participation. \"And no matter the political party or the candidate, there is a real hunger to be affiliated with the celebrities that can do that.\"Spillane said her research shows you don’t have to be a star as big as Swift to influence voters.\"Some of the other folks with a smaller base were having just as significant an impact because they have an incredibly engaged base of support as well,\" she said.\\xa0There’s a long history of big names throwing their weight behind White House hopefuls. It extends back to 1920 when film stars Mary Pickford and Al Jolson endorsed Warren G. Harding.Frank Sinatra explained his support of future president Ronald Reagan at a fundraising event in Boston in 1979.“Why do I support Governor Reagan?\" Sinatra said. \"Because I think he\\'s the proper man to be President of the United States. Because it\\'s so screwed up now, we need someone to straighten it out.”Oprah Winfrey offered her reasons for backing Barack Obama on The Larry King Show in 2007. \"What he stands for, what he has proven he can stand for, what he has shown, was worth me going out on a limb for,\" Winfrey said.A 2008 study from Northwestern University assessed the impact of Winfrey’s endorsement of Obama. It showed the media star was responsible for around one million additional votes for the 44th president.But other research tells a different story.For instance, a 2010 report from North Carolina State University found celebrity endorsements by George Clooney and Angelina Jolie did not help political candidates.And having famous people cheerleading for your political campaign isn’t foolproof.\"It could backfire,\" said Wharton School of Business professor of neuroscience, psychology, and marketing Michael Platt, the author of a 2023 study on celebrity endorsement. \"Maybe it\\'s a celebrity that you don\\'t like or is not aligned with you politically.\"There’s also the potential problem of the celebrity being too famous. Platt calls this the “Vampire Effect.”\"They suck up all our attention, right?\" he said. \"Which means there\\'s less attention, less processing, that\\'s given to the candidate that you might be endorsing.\"The rise of social media and deep-fakes created by artificial intelligence, such as those of Swift falsely appearing to endorse Trump, is also an issue.\"There have been manipulated celebrity photographs since the beginning of photography, certainly, but the rampant use of AI and its ubiquity are what is new,\" said Douglas Mirell, an entertainment lawyer with the Los Angeles firm Greenberg Glusker who works to curb unauthorized uses of AI. \"It is so pervasive and so potentially manipulable, that people can\\'t tell what\\'s true and what\\'s not true. So AI really does create a much more serious threat to the fundamental touchstone of democracy, which is truth-telling.\"Mirell said the impact of AI-generated images, on election results remains to be seen.\"When we\\'re talking about people like Taylor Swift or Beyoncé, their endorsements would be potentially very important,\" he said. \"And that\\'s why I think everyone really needs to be concerned about this issue.\"Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",
       " \" According to Foundation for Freedom Online Executive Director Mike Benz, “Taylor Swift is NATO’s nuclear weapon for soft power influence.”\\r He explained how the presenter of the NATO Psychological Operations Center panel discussion on information warfare said that Swift and others of her ilk could be “trained to spread desired messaging about NATO as they had successfully used her and other celebrities for other adjacent priorities around everything from public health to other social issues.”\\r Given how much NATO would rather see Harris in office than Trump, it is very convenient that Swift is being so vocal in endorsing Harris now. He believes that the effect would have been even stronger had she endorsed Harris from the outset of her nomination and theorizes that the timing may be an attempt to build the illusion that Harris won the debate and that her performance was so compelling that Swift simply couldn’t keep her admiration to herself any longer.\\r However, he says this election is a different story than the times Swift endorsed Clinton and Biden in the past.

       " '“I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” the pop star writes on InstagramTaylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president Tuesday night following the presidential debate between Harris and Donald Trump. In a message shared on social media, Swift wrote in part, “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Swift wrote in full:“Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.”“Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”“I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for\\xa0@kamalaharris\\xa0because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate\\xa0@timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”“I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.”“With love and hope,Taylor SwiftChildless Cat Lady”In February Trump insisted there is “no way” Swift would endorse the then-presumptive 2024 nominee President Biden, despite the singer’s endorsement of Biden in 2020. He wrote on Truth Social, “Trump’s post read in full, “I signed and was responsible for the for the Music Modernization Act for Taylor Swift and all other Musical Artists. Joe Biden didn’t do anything for Taylor, and never will. There’s no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money.”Months later in August Trump “accepted” a fake endorsement from Swift. After he posted a series of photos of women wearing shirts that read “Swifties for Trump” he added an AI-generated photo of Swift dressed as Uncle Sam that contained the text “Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump” and wrote, “I accept!”Swift faced backlash online after she attended the US Open alongside boyfriend Travis Kelce, his teammate Patrick Mahomes, and Mahomes’ wife Brittany, who Trump previously thanked for “strongly defending me” after she liked a post on Instagram about the GOP nominee. Former NFL star Antonio Brown was among those who were displeased with Swift following the outing. Brown shared a photo of Swift and Mahomes hugging and wrote, “White People for Trump.”White People for Trump pic.twitter.com/eShBHStGDXIn an interview with Outkick published in May, Brown himself told the outlet he planned to vote for Trump.

I am tired of dropping $500.00 for groceries for the month 50% commissary -&- 50% Korean super market and a tank a gas in my Gladiator. I am tired of inflation and high interest rates.

You think its tough now? I predict Nissin stocks will go up sharply as we all indulge in a healthy hot cup of Seafood Cup. I prefer the Curry cheese ones myself. Lets get it over with.

Now, if she could just tell me where to invest...It is quote remarkable how \"celebrity\" assumes such a public \"endorsement\" justifies the arrogant belief insistence that the value of their single \"vote\" count more, stands above, can cancel out the poor/ordinary population electorate.I don\\'t begrudge Taylor Swift for her wealth - I think she\\'s earned it - but doubt she\\'s thought through this endorsement very deeply at all.It was the cats. That is going to be the viral moment. Swift, like many others, was appalled by the GOP nominee for President going on a rant about immigrants coming in and eating cats and dogs.

Thank you cats.After Taylor Swifts endorsement, the MAGA media are already circulating excuses for Trump\\'s defeat.Republicans blame moderators for Trump\\'s poor debate performancehttps://www.yahoo.com/news/republicans-blame-moderators-trumps-poor-055907717.htmlTonight, It seems Trump will be doing a lot of childish namecalling at Taylor Swift and the moderators on his phone in bed with his McDonald\\'s Happy Meal.Luckily, Melania\\'s bedroom is not too far away so she can laugh at his whining!Because Trump is such a familiar figure — and because views of him are so fixed — there’s little left for him to say or do to change how voters see him, one way or the other. Getting repeatedly fact-checked by ABC’s moderators won’t upend his campaign. So the former president is likely to hold onto the 45% or so of voters who tell pollsters they support him — the same 45% who voted for him in 2016 and 2020.Yet 45% isn’t enough to win an election. What Trump really needed to do Tuesday night was change how voters see Harris — or let Harris do the job herself. Instead, Trump allowed his opponent to project precisely the kind of presidential, forward-looking positivity she wanted to project — without provoking any of the meandering, word-salad responses that have\\xa0caused her problems in the past.That probably means Harris won the debate.Taylor Swift\\'s endorsement will help to solidify that 51%+ that Harris will receive to be the US\\'s first woman, first Black woman, and first Asian woman to become not only the VP but also President.I\\'m critical of narcissistic celebrities who feel compelled to talk about topics they know nothing about.How do you know she is a narcissist, was compelled, or knows nothing about the topic (of who she plans to vote for)?Do you know more than her because you aren\\'t famous?I\\'m critical of narcissistic celebrities who feel compelled to talk about topics they know nothing about.Are you talking about Trump, Musk, or someone else?I can see why female celebrities like Taylor Swift and Hines are behind Harris.Trump\\'s talking points were:Abortions at 9 months. Crime on the rise. People eating pets. Trump\\'s main debate points. All WRONG of course, but MAGAs believe it. CORRECTION: They actually found the guy who is eating pets. Unfortunately for Trump, it\\'s RFK Jr.\\'The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the one who wins this election\\'  -Nikki HaleyTaylor Swift agrees with Nikki Haley, and she endorse the right candidate for her interests!▎\\xa0During the debate, she claimed that abortions “after birth” are illegal in every state.Which they are not@Data - Stop try to spread misinformation by taking my words out context. This is AI-generated pictures of Taylor Swift by Trump and his MAGA friends!Those two sentences are not in the same posts!I would like anything even remotely resembling a source for this extraordinary claim, please.LOL! I would like evidence for your claim, first!No, there are 3 facilities in Minnesota that do late term abortions, and yes, there are a few police documented cases of dogs and cats that were eaten, it’s not about what you want to believe, these are fact’s documented by the police and medical recordsThe moderators fact checked Trump! @Bass, your point is moot!However, I have a fact check for Kamala Harris:During the debate, she claimed that abortions “after birth” are illegal in every state.Explain to me then how we all saw - with our own two eyes - that she absolutely DESTROY a 78-year-old baby on National Television?Win farm-fresh ice cream, organic vegetables and more from local farms and businesses in Niseko.

       " '\\n\\n      World\\n  \\n\\n\\n      World\\n  \\nTaylor Swift, a self-declared \"childless cat lady,\" has endorsed Kamala Harris for president of the United States.The global megastar broke her silence on Tuesday (Sep 10) on the current state of US politics, voicing support for Harris over Donald Trump for the White House, and calling the Democratic candidate a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\".\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" she posted on Instagram in the minutes following a televised presidential debate that saw the candidates face off for the first time, which Swift said she had watched.\"I\\'m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,\" Swift wrote.\"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"She signed off her Instagram post by dubbing herself a \"childless cat lady\", a swipe at a much-mocked sentiment expressed by Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance which he had wielded in a bid to insult Democratic women.A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Until Tuesday, Swift had been conspicuously quiet on the subject, even as many of her fans began organising under the banner \"Swifties for Kamala\" and raising tens of thousands of dollars for the Democratic hopeful.But the 34-year-old said that discovering that AI-generated images of her falsely endorsing Trump, which \"conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation\", had inspired her to speak up.\"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,\" she said. \"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\"She encouraged her legions of loyal fans to \"do your research\".Swift, fresh off the European leg of her blockbuster Eras tour, baulked at explicitly telling her ardent supporters to vote Harris, instead saying \"I\\'ve done my research, and I\\'ve made my choice\".\"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\"The artist did voice special support for Harris\\'s choice of a running mate, Tim Walz, praising the Minnesota governor for \"standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman\\'s right to her own body for decades\".A global celebrity with hundreds of millions of social media followers and a wildly loyal - and chronically online - fan base, Swift can move any needle with the tiniest of efforts.The right and the left have long wanted to count the Blank Space singer as their own - but for years Swift stayed conspicuously out of politics, including in 2016 when Donald Trump won the presidency.Speculation abounded that the superstar was a closet Republican until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right politician Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.Blackburn won anyway, but it ushered in a new chapter for Swift.She later explained that handlers had urged her against wading into politics, telling her it could damage her career - particularly in the country music industry, which despite its complexities is often associated with conservatism.Swift endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and has conveyed pro-LGBTQ messages through her songs and music videos.She also condemned the Supreme Court\\'s reversal of the federal right to abortion, and has encouraged droves of her fans to register to vote.But Swift\\'s massive popularity has also meant she\\'s a regular target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, often fueled by AI and amplified by the likes of Trump.Speaking out on her own terms gripped the news cycle within seconds of going live, and her post notched more than two million \"likes\" after just 30 minutes.\"With love and hope, Taylor Swift,\" she concluded her message.Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inboxStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best storiesGet WhatsApp alertsJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat appCopyright© Mediacorp 2024.

       " \"Getty ImageKansas City Chiefs president Mark Donovan shared in a new interview how the team plans to deal with another year of Taylor Swift mania in Arrowhead Stadium.While Taylor Swift didn’t attend a Chiefs game last year until the third week of the NFL season, this year Kansas City has three home games before she will have to jet off to perform on her world tour.“With Taylor, she brings a lot with her and it’s a pretty valuable targeted demographic when you look at the makeup of her fan base,” Mark Donovan told David Rumsey of Front Office Sports. “And we’ve looked at ways that we can be respectful. “I had a great conversation with with Travis [Kelce] the first game that Taylor came to, this was prior to the game, and I grabbed Travis after practice and just said, ‘Hey, I’m hearing through the grapevine that Taylor’s coming to the game.’ “He said, ‘Yeah, she wants to come to the game. That’s on her. I’m gonna focus on the game.’ “I’m like, ‘Okay, that’s fine, um, it’s Taylor Swift, so we sort of have to plan for this and make sure, we’ve got a plan for her. We’re going to take her through these certain entrances and you know, make sure that she’s safe and make sure that we manage the crowd reaction.“And Travis’s response was, ‘She wants to come as a fan. She doesn’t want all this stuff. Deal with her. I’m playing football.’ “And I was like okay, but you know she can’t come through the main gate. That’s not gonna work. And he said, ‘No, she wants to come through the main gate like a fan. “I’m like, ‘Trav, like, that can’t happen.’ “And so we had this entire intricate plan. Her security team came the day before. We had this great way of getting in and out, everything was going to be great. You know, unlike we do with other VIPs. “So the day of the game I get a call from our head of security saying Taylor doesn’t like the plan. She’s coming through the main gate. And she did. She, you know, put on a hat and a COVID mask and some sunglasses and brought a group of people and they all came right through the main gate.“Because that’s what she wants. She wants to be a fan, right? This is her off time. She wants to to be there and support Travis um and we’re going to create that opportunity or we provide that opportunity.”Donovan also said the Chiefs made a point last season in Arrowhead Stadium to not play a single Taylor Swift song during games.“That was a sign of respect,” he said. “Like, we’re not trying to capitalize on this. We’re trying to celebrate it, but it’s not about, you know, doing too much or showing her every touchdown or anything like that. She never appeared on our big board. “We had one day when we had, you know, six or seven big celebrities in the stadium and so prior to the game, you know, we show them on the sideline and put them on the big board and the fans react and it’s another way of saying like, ‘This is the place to be. The coolest people in entertainment are here too.’ “And I went to Travis afterwards I’m like, ‘It’s a little odd to me that we showed like four Hollywood people, two entertainers, a comedian, and Taylor’s in her suite watching but we’re not showing her. He’s like, ‘Let’s just keep doing it the way we’re doing it.'”Considering the fact that, as Front Office Sports reports, Taylor Swift generated an equivalent brand value of $331.5 million for the Chiefs and the NFL in 2023, it’s little wonder they are more than willing to bend over backwards to please her (and promote her).\",\n",
       " 'Haters gonna hate.Scooter Braun had a special message for Donald Trump after the former US president claimed he “hates” Taylor Swift.“Shake it off Donald,” the former talent manager wrote via his Instagram Stories Sunday alongside a screenshot of Trump’s vulgar message.“Kamala 2024,” Braun, 43, added, alluding he is voting for 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the forthcoming election.The producer, who infamously\\xa0“stripped” Swift of her “life’s work” and acquired the singer’s masters, spoke out against Trump, 78, after the politician expressed his distaste for the pop star hours earlier.“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump spoke out against the “Lover” songstress, 34, after she publicly endorsed Harris following the 2024 presidential debate last week.“I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,” she wrote on Instagram.“I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” Swift continued.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStart your day with Page Six Daily.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPlease provide a valid email address.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBy clicking above you agree to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTerms of Use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t and \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPrivacy Policy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWant celebrity news as it breaks?

She’s a big Trump fan,” he said on an interview with “Fox & Friends.”Trump previously referred to the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes as “beautiful” after she was criticized for “strongly defending” him.“I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country,” he wrote on social media earlier this month.\\n\\nAdvertisement',\n",

The post, published shortly after the U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday night, positioned Harris as the candidate who would champion the rights and causes Swift holds dear.“As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can,” Swift wrote to her 283 million followers, adding: “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election.”A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Swift emphasized her support for Harris, describing her as a “steady-handed, gifted leader” capable of steering the country with calmness, in contrast to the “chaos” she associates with other candidates.Swift’s post also featured an image of her with her beloved cat, Benjamin Button, nodding to comments made by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, who had previously mocked senior Democratic leaders as “childless cat ladies.” Swift embraced the label, signing off her statement with “Childless cat lady.”Swift’s endorsement didn’t come without addressing misinformation. She referred to AI-generated images, circulated by former President Donald Trump’s campaign in August, falsely depicting her and her fans endorsing Trump. Swift expressed her concerns over AI’s potential for spreading falsehoods, calling it a key reason for her public clarification of her voting intentions.“I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift said, urging her followers to research candidates’ positions on issues that matter to them.In response to Swift’s endorsement, the Trump campaign dismissed her support as further evidence of the Democratic Party’s alignment with “wealthy elites,” with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stating, “There’s many Swifties for Trump out there in America.” Republican congressman Matt Gaetz also commented on Swift’s political stance, remarking, “I love her songs, but I want to live in a world where liberals make my art and conservatives make my laws and policies.”However, Swift’s backing of Harris has garnered significant attention among her fanbase, with some already mobilizing in support of the Democratic candidate. The Swifties for Kamala Coalition, launched in August, has raised over $138,000 for the Harris campaign, further bolstering the vice president’s candidacy.Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, expressed his gratitude to Swift during an MSNBC interview, stating, “Her endorsement took courage, and that’s the kind of courage we need in America.”Historically, celebrity endorsements have had measurable impacts on elections. A study from Northwestern University and the University of Maryland estimated that Oprah Winfrey’s endorsement of Barack Obama ahead of the 2008 Democratic primary earned him around one million votes. Whether Swift’s massive following, particularly among Gen Z and women, will have a similar effect remains to be seen.Swift’s endorsement marks a significant moment in the 2024 election, highlighting the intersection of pop culture and politics. As the election approaches, her influence may yet play a pivotal role in shaping the outcome, particularly among younger voters and those concerned with women’s rights.Top US, China, Russia officials gather at Southeast Asia summitTaylor Swift’s epic concert rocks Seattle with seismic forceSarawak Engineer falls victim to Taylor Swift ticket fraud, losing USD 2,468Taylor Swift fans in Indonesia eagerly await six-day concert series in SingaporeSwifties queue at SingPost outlets 2 days before Taylor Swift concert ticket General On-saleUOB pre-sale tickets for Taylor Swift’s concert sold out within 3 hoursOn 22 September 2024, Israeli soldiers raided Al Jazeera’s office in Ramallah, ordering its closure for 45 days. The raid occurred in Area A, a zone under Palestinian control as per the Oslo Accords, but where Israel continues to exert military influence. The closure order cites accusations of incitement and support for terrorism.PublishedonByIn a pre-dawn raid on 22 September 2024, heavily armed Israeli soldiers entered the Al Jazeera bureau in Ramallah, ordering its immediate closure for 45 days.The soldiers handed a shutdown notice to bureau chief Walid al-Omari, citing accusations of “incitement” and “support for terrorism.” The bureau, located in Area A of the occupied West Bank—supposedly under the control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) under the Oslo Accords—was nonetheless subject to Israeli military authority.This raid marks the latest in a series of actions by Israeli forces against the Qatari-based Al Jazeera network, a major international media outlet with significant global reach, known for its extensive reporting on Middle Eastern affairs.The outlet has frequently drawn the ire of Israeli officials for its reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with its journalists often facing violence or harassment. In a notable case in 2022, prominent Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed by Israeli forces while covering a raid in the West Bank city of Jenin.In the Ramallah raid, soldiers were observed tearing down a large banner of Abu Akleh inside the bureau, which had been placed in her memory.Despite Ramallah being under the PA’s jurisdiction, Israel has routinely conducted military operations in this Oslo-defined Area A. A 2023 report by the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process highlighted several Israeli operations in Area A between June and September of that year, which resulted in significant Palestinian casualties.Such operations underscore the ongoing Israeli military presence and impunity across the West Bank, regardless of the legal distinction between Areas A, B, and C.During the raid, Israeli soldiers ordered the staff, who were working the overnight shift, to evacuate immediately.While initially permitted to take their personal belongings, staff were eventually required to leave behind key equipment, including cameras. Al Jazeera’s Jivara Budeiri, who was present during the raid, noted that engineers accompanied the soldiers, raising fears that the raid might have been intended to damage or confiscate the bureau’s archives. The team spent several hours standing outside the building, unable to retrieve their vehicles or continue reporting.Armed Israeli soldiers patrolled the area in military vehicles while gunfire and tear gas were heard nearby.The closure order, which is in effect for 45 days, raises concerns that the shutdown could be prolonged. Al Jazeera’s bureau chief, al-Omari, speculated that the closure may be automatically renewed, much like the closure of the network’s bureau in Israel earlier in 2024.That bureau was shut down under what became known as the “Al Jazeera Law,” passed by the Israeli Knesset, which allows the government to temporarily close foreign media outlets deemed to pose a security threat.The Ramallah shutdown, however, comes from the Israeli military authority, which technically has no legal power over Area A under international agreements.According to al-Omari, any attempt to appeal the closure will likely need to go through Israel’s opaque military courts system, which often operates on the basis of “secret evidence” and allows for indefinite detentions without formal charges. Given this, there is skepticism that the bureau will be able to resume operations after the 45-day period.This raid also coincides with escalating regional tensions, particularly involving Hezbollah in Lebanon. Recent explosions in southern Lebanon, suspected to be part of an Israeli sabotage campaign, have resulted in the deaths of at least 37 people, including two children.The possibility of an expanded conflict looms, as Israel remains on high alert amid concerns of Hezbollah’s involvement in the broader Israel-Palestine conflict.The closure of Al Jazeera’s Ramallah bureau further heightens concerns over press freedom in the region. Al Jazeera has long been a critical source of information on Israel’s military operations and human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories.Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University in Beirut, remarked to Al Jazeera that this raid is part of Israel’s broader effort since 1948 to prevent the dissemination of information about its policies toward Palestinians, including colonization, arrests, and torture.Khouri emphasized that Al Jazeera plays a vital role in bringing global attention to these issues, making it a frequent target of Israeli authorities.Israeli soldiers reportedly pushed three lifeless bodies off rooftops during a raid in the West Bank on 14 September 2023. The incident, captured on video, has sparked criticism from rights groups and calls for an investigation. Although the Israeli military says it is reviewing the matter, rights groups point out that Israel rarely, if ever, takes meaningful action against its soldiers in such cases.PublishedonByIsraeli soldiers were seen pushing three apparently lifeless bodies off rooftops during a military operation in Qabatiya, a town in the northern West Bank, on Thursday (19 Sept), according to an Associated Press (AP) journalist and footage obtained by the news agency.The incident occurred during a broader Israeli crackdown in the West Bank amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Rights groups allege the action is part of a pattern of excessive force used against Palestinians.The AP journalist who witnessed the scene reported that soldiers pushed the bodies off adjacent multi-story buildings, while other troops stood below.This was further corroborated by additional reporters at the site.In one video, soldiers were seen dragging a stiff body to the edge of a roof and then dropping it. On a nearby rooftop, soldiers swung another body over the edge, while in a third instance, a body was kicked off a roof.Photos captured by AP show an Israeli army bulldozer near the buildings.Israel’s military confirmed the operation, stating that its troops had killed four militants during the raid in Qabatiya. The Israeli military acknowledged the seriousness of the incident, stating, “This is a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values and the expectations from IDF soldiers. The incident is under review.”The Palestinian Health Ministry, however, confirmed only one death and reported that 10 Palestinians had been hospitalized due to Israeli gunfire. The identities of the deceased and their causes of death remain unclear.In response to the footage, Shawan Jabarin, the director of the Palestinian rights group Al-Haq, condemned the treatment of the bodies as “savage” and unnecessary, stating that it violated international law regarding the treatment of the deceased, including combatants.He further expressed scepticism that Israel would conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. “The most that will happen is that soldiers will be disciplined, but there will be no real investigation and no real prosecution,” Jabarin said.The raid in Qabatiya is part of Israel’s ongoing military operations in the West Bank which is governed by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which have intensified since the outbreak of war with Hamas on 7 October 2023.Israel has defended its actions as necessary to suppress growing militancy, citing attacks by Palestinian gunmen on checkpoints and inside Israel.Over 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.The northern West Bank has been a focal point of violence, with numerous deaths and arrests reported over the past months. Earlier in September, Israel carried out its deadliest raid into the region since the war’s outbreak, killing at least 33 Palestinians.The Israeli government’s recent approval of nearly 5,300 new homes in West Bank settlements in July further complicates the situation. The international community, including the United Nations and rights organizations, has consistently condemned Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank as violations of international law.On Wednesday, the United Nations General Assembly passed a nonbinding resolution calling on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territories within a year. The resolution, backed by 124 votes to 12, urged Israel to withdraw its “unlawful presence” in the West Bank and pay reparations for damages caused by the occupation. It also supported a previous advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice, which declared the settlements illegal.As violence in Gaza continues to dominate global attention, rights groups are increasingly raising concerns about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank, where the situation remains highly volatile.Minister K Shanmugam transfers Astrid Hill GCB to UBS Trustees for S$88 Million following Ridout Road controversyDr Tan Cheng Bock questions S$335 million Founders’ Memorial cost, citing Lee Kuan Yew’s stanceLeaders of Japanese syndicate accused of laundering S$628.7M lived in SingaporeLee Hsien Loong warns of limited political space if election margins narrowChee Soon Juan questions Shanmugam’s $88 million property sale amid silence from Mainstream MediaDo Singaporeans want to give the PAP a blank cheque again?Halimah Yaacob proposes classifying platform workers as employees for enhanced protectionsNetizens criticise SM Lee’s ‘fearmongering’ remarks, call for stronger opposition for checks and balancesCopyright © 2024 The Online Citizen',\n",
       " 'With a net worth that exceeds the GDP of many small countries and a fan base known for its zeal, Taylor Swift is one of the biggest artists of the century — and commands immense influence in our culture.Yet in this intense election season, Swift has fallen silent on politics, despite several much-hyped endorsements in the past. For the good of all, let’s hope she remains mum.Millions of Switfties follow her relentlessly, adopting her fashion whims and scrutinizing her lyrics to discern which ex she may be referring to in a single couplet tucked away in a chorus.Meanwhile, Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has built an unexpected bridge between very distinct American subcultures — football fans and pop-music followers — that’s spun up endless headlines. \\xa0Even ISIS recognizes her reach: A pair of would-be terrorists recently tried to use a Swift concert as a vehicle to send a message to the West via a thwarted attack, drawing universal outrage.America today is a house divided — where Republicans and Democrats don’t just vote for different policies but live in different places, shop at different stores, wear different clothing, eat different food and watch different media.As Charles Murray argued in his book “Coming Apart,” the powerful upper classes increasingly\\xa0live in cultural\\xa0enclaves surrounded by their own kind, reinforcing an increasing class and cultural chasm that threatens to put the American project at risk.The traditional icons of American patriotism that once bonded Americans and transcended politics and culture, like the flag itself, have become engulfed in culture-war controversy.But Taylor Swift is our surprising unifier.Swift had the highest net favorability rating of any figure tested in one recent\\xa0NBC News national poll — the only person to draw a positive response from both Republicans and Democrats.Her ability to penetrate and shape culture cannot be understated.In 2018, Swift ventured into politics for the first time when she urged her fans to vote for Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen in a US Senate race that Republican Marsha Blackburn narrowly won.Swift later endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, claiming that Donald Trump had been “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism” during his presidency.Her past support for Democrats has fueled rampant speculation that she will soon do the same for Kamala Harris — including wild rumors that she would appear as a surprise guest at the Democratic National Convention.But that never happened, leaving pundits and fans in suspense.While some express frustration at her quiet — a group dubbing itself “Swifties4Kamala” has formed to campaign for the Democrat without their idol — the superstar’s political silence should be celebrated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPlease provide a valid email address.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBy clicking above you agree to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTerms of Use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t and \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPrivacy Policy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNever miss a story.\\t\\t\\t\\tAn endorsement of Harris, a polarizing political figure, could alienate a significant portion of her fan base, undermining the very connection that has made her so successful.“The positive effects of a celebrity endorsement are minimal for politician,” said researcher Michael Cobb\\xa0of North Carolina State University. “Instead, it’s much easier for perceptions of a celebrity to be adversely affected by giving his or her endorsement.”Instead of divisive rhetoric, Taylor must use her massive platform for unity.Politics in recent years has brought us divided workplaces, friend groups and even families.Music, on the other hand, heals — transcending differences in ideology, race, nations.We love “Shake It Off” not because of its profound policy exhortations, but because it’s a spirited take on the realities of Swift’s superstardom set to an entrancing beat. We don’t sing along to “Love Story” for its critique of the war in Iraq or its advocacy for socialized medicine; we let it transport us to a more innocent time of naïve love.Our political system is in a dire state, and its vitriol is reaching system-breaking levels. The last thing we need is another celebrity to spew hyperpartisan hot takes, especially a star who transcends our differences as Swift does. Taylor, for the good of the country, endorse unity — not a candidate — in this election. With all the dread, division and uncertainty surrounding this contest, well, you can help us just shake it off.Andrew\\xa0Stein, a\\xa0Democrat, served as New York City Council president,1986-94.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Hollywood Life\\n\\nLatest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe singer told her 283 million Instagram followers about her plans to vote for Harris-Walz, signing the endorsement as \"Childless Cat Lady.\"\\t\\t\\t\\nFind Out\\nIt might be hard for J.D. Vance and the Trump team to shake this one off.Here’s everything to know about the mega pop star’s endorsement, which she shared with her 283 million followers on Instagram.Taylor Swift formally endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris shortly after the two presidential candidates stepped off the debate stage in Philadelphia, PA.In a lengthy statement on Instagram on Tuesday, September 10, the “Karma” singer expressed her support while also criticizing the Republican candidate and his team for using AI-generated images with her likeness earlier this summer.“Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight,” Swift began in the post. “If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.”She continued, “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Donald Trump previously shared the AI-generated images on his Truth Social platform.Besides the AI reason stated, Swift described Harris as “a steady-handed, gifted leader” and that she has been “so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate” Gov. Tim Walz\\xa0“who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”Soon after, Walz appeared on MSNBC, where the host Rachel Maddow read Swift’s endorsement to him in its entirety. “I am incredibly grateful, first of all, to Taylor Swift,” Walz said, putting his hand over his heart. “I say that also as a cat owner — a fellow cat owner.”The singer emphasized her decision, concluding, “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.”Trump was asked to react to the news of Swift’s endorsement of his opponent—which now has almost 6 million likes. “I have no idea,” the GOP nominee said in response.The 14-time Grammy winner included a photo of herself holding one of her cats and signed the post with “Childless cat lady” — a direct jab at Trump’s running mate, Vance, whose comments resurfaced earlier this year.A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Vance had complained that America is being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies, who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made,” while referring to Harris, who has two stepchildren through her marriage to Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.After expressing regret for not speaking out more against Trump during his first run in 2016, the singer has taken a more active political stance, speaking out on issues such as abortion access. Similar to this year’s later-than-expected endorsement, Swift endorsed Joe Biden closer to the election, on October 7, 2020.In 2020, Swift’s endorsement of Biden and Harris generated significant backlash from conservatives, who urged her to keep her music career apolitical.In November 2023, a national NBC News poll found that 40% of registered voters had positive views of Swift, while 16% had negative views. A majority of Democrats (53%) viewed her positively, while 28% of Republicans felt the same.While there has been much speculation in the media this year about whether Swift would publicly announce her endorsement, Swifties have quickly rallied behind Harris.Swifties for Kamala, a fan group with no official affiliation with either woman, expressed their excitement. “We’ve had no doubt that Taylor would endorse at the right time and are excited about the momentum she will bring to this campaign,” Irene Kim, the group’s co-founder, said in a statement.Follow Us:About UsLegalNewsConnect',\n",

       " 'Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president moments after the end of Tuesday night\\'s presidential debate against Donald Trump.The pop star made her announcement in an Instagram post signed as \"Childless Cat Lady\" - a reference to comments by Trump\\'s running mate JD Vance.Her post, breaking her silence on the 2024 vote, explained: \"I\\'m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"Within 24 hours of her announcement, nearly 340,000 people had visited the voter registration website, vote.gov, using a custom link created and shared by Swift.Swift, who also backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020, called Harris a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\".She added: \"I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"Swift\\'s text was accompanied by a photo of her with a cat. Her \"Childless Cat Lady\" comment was a nod to remarks made in 2021 by Vance, who is Trump\\'s candidate for vice-president.Vance, the Ohio senator, has faced a backlash for a clip in which he called several prominent Democrats - including Harris - \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\". He recently said his comments were \"sarcastic\".Swift went on to compliment Harris\\'s choice of vice-presidential candidate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who she said had been \"been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman\\'s right to her own body for decades\".The singer said she was in part motivated to share her voting decision with the public after an AI image of her falsely endorsing Trump was posted on his website.\"It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\" she said. \"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\"Trump went on to embrace the fake images in a post that sparked a backlash among Swift\\'s fans - or Swifties - who accused Trump of spreading misinformation.In response to Swift\\'s endorsement of Harris, Trump told Fox News that \"was not a Taylor Swift fan.\" He called her a \"very liberal person\" and said that she will \"pay the price for it in the marketplace.\"Trump supporter Elon Musk, known to be the father of 12 children, posted on his social-media platform X (formerly Twitter): \"Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.\"Meanwhile, Harris\\'s running mate Walz told MSNBC on Tuesday night after learning about the endorsement he was grateful to Swift \"as a fellow cat owner.\"Swift is one of several celebrities to endorse Harris, including singers John Legend and Olivia Rodrigo, actor George Clooney and director Spike Lee.Meanwhile, former wrestler Hulk Hogan, TV star Amber Rose and billionaire Elon Musk have endorsed Trump.Swift\\'s intervention came after a fiery 90-minute presidential debate, during which the two candidates sparred over issues such as abortion rights, the economy and immigration.It is not the first time the pop star has endorsed the Democratic nominee in a race against Trump. Swift announced her support for President Joe Biden and Harris as his vice-president a month before the 2020 election.Swift was also a vocal critic of Trump during his presidency surrounding the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd.\"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?\" she posted on Twitter/X. \"We will vote you out in November.\"Noting Swift\\'s political past, one academic who studies the intersection of media and politics suggested that the endorsement was unlikely to move the needle in Harris\\'s favour.\"No surprise at all, she endorsed Biden and Harris in 2020 so we already knew her politics,\" said Lauren Rosewarne, a University of Melbourne professor.Swift\\'s endorsement could impact voter registration, Ms Rosewarne told the BBC. But because her fan-base skews young and female - and that is already the Harris supporter base - her endorsement may not have a big impact come November. The singer has 283 million followers on Instagram. Her endorsement has received more than 4.5 million likes on Instagram less than three hours after she posted it.In her post, Swift urged first-time voters to register and said she would post a link with more voting information on her page.\"I\\'ve done my research, and I\\'ve made my choice,\" she said. \"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\"North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

       " \"Make America Great Again — Donald’s Version.Former President Donald Trump trolled Taylor Swift and her fans with the release of a mock Eras Tour T-shirt, days after the pop superstar endorsed his Democratic opponent.The Trump campaign X account posted the “Trump Era shirt” and announced that the team was “Calling all Swifties for Trump” by peddling the merchandise in exchange for donations of between $45 and $1,000.“Look what you made him do,” the campaign captioned an email announcing the sale.The fundraising drive has a goal of 200,000 donors, and was better than 90% there as of Friday morning.The white T-shirt mimicked the color scheme and multi-paneled design of Swift’s tee for her more than $1 billion-generating Eras Tour. The $45 minimum donation matches the original cost of the “Shake It Off” singer’s merchandise.Panels on the shirt feature Trump’s defiant fist pump after being shot at at a rally in July, his infamous mugshot in Fulton County, Ga., following his 2020 election interference indictment, his embrace of the US flag during an address to business owners in 2018, and his old Twitter profile picture.With hundreds of thousands of impressions on X, Swifties and MAGA diehards clashed over the decision.“Make America Gag Again,” one X user replied, referencing Trump’s famed motto.“I hope you get sued within an inch of your existence. He’s fixing to be in his unemployed little b**** era,” another X user raged.“I’m excited for trumps [sic] new era, I heard it’s called the ‘lawsuit era,'” still another joked.There was no immediate response from Swift or her team. The shirt is an obvious parody, which is generally protected under the First Amendment.While liberal Swifties were enraged by the design, the fans of the artist who support Trump were delighted with the announcement — but had notes for its designer. “Can we please get a proper Trump Eras t-shirt with pictures from throughout his life instead of it all basically being from his latter era?” asked a Trump-Swiftie hybrid fan on X.One even quibbled with how accurately the 45th president had mapped his profile onto Swift’s album artwork, writing, “whoever made this did not understand the assignment because his mug shot so obviously should have been reputation,” a reference to Swift’s sixth album which featured a black-and-white cover.Swift, 34, backed Vice President Kamala Harris minutes after the Democratic candidate debated Trump on Tuesday night, calling her “a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”The announcement did little to hurt Swift’s massive following, but drove more than 400,000 followers to visit vote.gov to register over the following 24 hours, according to the General Services Administration.The endorsement was signed “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady,” in a nod to remarks GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance had made about the US being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies” who are “miserable.”In response, Trump ally and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted to X: “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.”Both Trump and Vance shrugged off the support for Harris.“I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth. She’s a big Trump fan,” the former president told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” Wednesday, referring to Swift’s friend Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick.“We admire Taylor Swift’s music, but I don’t think most Americans, whether they like her music or are fans of hers or not, are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans,”\\xa0Vance told Fox News’ “The Story” on Wednesday.Advertisement\",\n",

       " 'Perhaps the most famous celebrity in the world has finally weighed in on the 2024 U.S. presidential election.Pop superstar Taylor Swift announced her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris moments after the conclusion of a debate between the Democratic nominee and her Republican opponent former President Donald Trump, putting to bed any uncertainty about Swift’s political leanings after some criticisms had bubbled on social media over her not being more clear sooner. The election is less than 60 days away, and voting has already begun.“Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight,” the TIME Person of the Year wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday night. “I’m voting for [Harris] because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.” A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Swift’s post, which featured a photo of her with her cat that was taken from her TIME cover photoshoot last year, was signed off with her name, followed by “Childless Cat Lady”—a reference to Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance’s controversial comments about his Democratic opponents and women who choose not to give birth. By contrast, Swift added that she was “heartened and impressed” by Harris’ selection of running mate Minn. Gov. Tim Walz “who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”The endorsement came after months of speculation of an impending endorsement from Swift, who previously endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in the 2020 election and slammed Trump that same year for defunding the U.S. Postal Service and threatening police violence amid racial justice protests.In her post, Swift also debunked posts shared by Trump last month, including some generated by artificial intelligence, that suggested she supported Trump. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded to the endorsement of Harris by Swift, a self-made billionaire, by calling it “further evidence that the Democratic Party has unfortunately become the party of the wealthy elite.”Criticism of Swift’s previous silence swelled over the weekend at the U.S. Open, where she was spotted embracing suspected Trump supporter Brittany Mahomes, the wife of NFL player Patrick Mahomes, a teammate of Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce. Brittany Mahomes has come under fire since she reportedly liked—and later unliked—an Instagram post by the former President last month, which he thanked her for. Some Swifties took to social media to express their disappointment with the singer’s ambiguous political stance.“I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice,” Swift wrote on Tuesday. “Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.”Phoning into Fox News on Wednesday morning, Trump said he’s “not a Taylor Swift fan” and that he “actually” likes Brittany Mahomes “much better.” As for Swift’s Harris endorsement, “it was just a question of time,” Trump said. “She’s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”Contact us at letters@time.com',\n",

       " \"Senior Reporter, HuffPostPop music sensation Taylor Swift, widely considered one of the world’s most influential celebrities, endorsed Kamala Harris for president after Tuesday night’s debate.“I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,” Swift said in an Instagram post featuring her with one of her cats. She signed her lengthy post as “Childless Cat Lady” ― a biting reference to GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s now widely mocked remarks disparaging Democratic women who don’t have children.A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Swift, once known for her aversion to speaking out about politics, praised Harris as someone who “fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.”“I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” her post continued.She also praised Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, praising him as someone “who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”Swift posted her endorsement minutes after Harris’ presidential debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump ended Tuesday night on ABC News.Questions about a potential endorsement from the 14-time Grammy Award winner have swirled for months, especially after Donald Trump shared AI-generated images of women wearing “Swifties for Trump” tees. When Swift’s team didn’t condemn his posts, fans and critics alike speculated that Swift would stay silent this election.She finally addressed that scandal in her endorsement Tuesday night.“It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” she wrote. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Swift’s endorsement comes days after she caught flak for photos of her embracing Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, whom Trump has praised for her support of him. Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, also plays for the Chiefs.Harris hasn’t said anything about Swift’s endorsement yet, but according to a CBS reporter, she walked out of her post-debate party to Swift’s feminist anthem “The Man.”MSNBC host Rachel Maddow was the one to break the news to Walz live on air, reading out Swift’s entire post to him as he smiled and clutched his chest.“I am incredibly grateful to Taylor Swift. I say that as a fellow cat owner,” Walz responded.As for Trump, when asked by Fox News reporters for his reaction to the Swift endorsement, he responded: “I have no idea.”Swift endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020.Consider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.Can't afford to contribute?

       " 'Steals & Deals: Up to 79% off a massage pillow, skin care, bedding, moreSectionsShowsMoreFollow todayMore BrandsTaylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Sept. 9 shortly after watching Harris and former President Donald Trump in their first presidential debate ahead of the election.On Instagram, Swift shared a photo of herself with her cat Benjamin — from her 2023 Time magazine Person of the Year cover — along with a written endorsement for Harris that she signed “Childless Cat Lady.”“Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,” Swift began. Swift wrote that she was recently made aware of an AI version of herself “falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run” that was posted to his website.“It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,” she wrote.“I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,\" the \"Karma\" singer explained. \"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,\" she penned. \"I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”Swift wrote that she is backing Harris after doing research and encouraged her followers to do the same.“Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story,” she continued, before signing off, “With love and hope, Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.”The phrase “childless cat lady” was used by Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, when he said that the U.S. was run by “childless cat ladies” who “force their misery on the rest of the country.”\\xa0He added that they have no direct stake in the future of the country because they don’t have kids. Since then, Harris’ family, including her stepchildren, have defended her.Harris has not directly responded to the pop star\\'s endorsement, but she did walk off stage to Swift\\'s feminist anthem \"The Man\" at her watch party in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, according to a video posted on Instagram.Following the debate on Sept. 10, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow asked Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, about Swift’s endorsement. Walz responded, “I am incredibly grateful, first of all to Taylor Swift, I say that also as a cat owner.”“Swifites, you heard it. You know that it’s there. That was eloquent and it was clear, and that’s the type of courage we need in America to stand up,” he said. “We’ve seen it out of those Republicans who were at the DNC.“We’ve seen it out of women who would like to have their own personal lives kept personal, but are forced to go out there because they nearly died because they can’t get abortion services in a pregnancy,” he continued. “And now you have somebody like Taylor Swift coming out and making that very clear.”Trump reacted to the news of Swift\\'s endorsement while calling in to \"Fox and Friends\" on the morning of Sept. 11, according to Variety.“It was only a question of time. She couldn’t possibly endorse Biden ... but she’s a very liberal person,” Trump said. “She seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”The former president added he likes Swift\\'s friend Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, \"much more.\"“Well I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better. If you want to know the truth. She’s a big Trump fan,” he said. “I was not a Taylor Swift fan.”He continued: “Brittany is great. She’s the one I like much better than Taylor Swift. Wife of the great quarterback. I think she’s terrific.”Vance also responded to Swift\\'s endorsement of Harris while on Fox News Sept. 11, saying, \"We admire Taylor Swift\\'s music, but I don’t think most Americans — whether they like her music, or fans of hers, or not — are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans.\"Swift has largely stayed out of politics until 2018, when she\\xa0endorsed former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, in the state Senate race against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn. Though Blackburn was elected, Swift has generally stayed vocal about her political opinions since.In August 2020, Swift endorsed Joe Biden for president.“Donald Trump’s ineffective leadership gravely worsened the crisis that we are in and he is now taking advantage of it to subvert and destroy our right to vote and vote safely,” Swift said in an Aug. 15, 2020\\xa0tweet. “Request a ballot early.

In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes.LIVE UPDATES: Trump and Harris debate in PhiladelphiaShe included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message “Childless Cat Lady.” The remark is a reference to three-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country’s future.A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest.“That was eloquent. And it was clear,” Walz said. “And that’s the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.”Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump’s decision to post AI-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said “Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.”Trump’s posts “brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift wrote. She added that “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice.”POLL: Harris narrowly leads Trump, but he’s ahead with these key groupsThe Trump campaign dismissed Swift’s endorsement.“This is further evidence that the Democrat Party has unfortunately become a party of the wealthy elites,” said spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.“There’s many Swifties for Trump out there in America,” she said, herself included.Swift’s endorsement was not exactly a surprise. In 2020, she supported President Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked “the fires of white supremacy and racism.”Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one.AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. That’s the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn.READ MORE: 10 takeaways from the Harris-Trump debateVoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55 percent of Democrats and just 19 percent of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state.Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday’s MTV Video Music Awards. While it’s unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris.The event was shifted a day later to accommodate Tuesday’s debate, and MTV has a long history of encouraging voter participation.Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Philadelphia, Linley Sanders in Washington and Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\\nLeft:\\n                Tatylor Swift's latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales.

       " 'The first presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris took place on Tuesday evening, with many prospective voters tuning in for information on policy, plans and more from both candidates.It has been a hotly contested election season, to put it mildly, and VP Harris landed a big endorsement at the conclusion of the debate. Pop star Taylor Swift, who had previously endorsed the ticket of Joe Biden and Harris in 2020, took to Instagram to re-up her support for the current Vice President.In the post, Swift encouraged her fans and followers to research the candidates, referenced former President Trump’s use of unapproved AI images of Swift for his campaign and stated her intention to clear up any misinformation around her stances.Swift said her reasons for supporting Kamala Harris included the fact that she is a “steady-handed, gifted leader.” The 14-time Grammy winner also praised VP Harris’s selection of Tim Walz as her Vice Presidential pick because he, “has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”The The Tortured Poets Department singer then closed with “Childless Cat Lady” under her name, a direct reference to Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance’s repeated comments about the societal group.A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)Swift closed with another encouragement to learn about the candidates and implored voters to register.

       " 'We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTaylor Swift at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards at Staples Center, Los Angeles. September 6, 2012 Los Angeles, CA Picture: Paul Smith\\n© Featureflash Photo Agency / shutterstock.com\\t\\t\\t\\tThis article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Imagine cleaning out your basement, finding what appears to be a charming but unremarkable painting, then scratching its surface to discover a Frida Kahlo self-portrait beneath. In 2012, Taylor Swift was a prominent country music artist with crossover appeal, but not a major force in entertainment. Then came the Red album and the genius began to appear. Comparisons with Mozart are now more commonplace and understood, and universities teach courses on her. She occupies the same kind of status as Madonna and Michael Jackson in the 1980s and 1990s and, earlier, Elvis Presley and the Beatles. The Kahlo is now visible. Is there yet another layer?Swift’s recent endorsement of United States presidential candidate Kamala Harris may conceal more than it reveals. After all, everyone knew her political allegiances lay with Democrats; none of her 284 million Instagram followers or anyone else would have been surprised that she wants Harris to win the forthcoming election. Maybe the endorsement is something more: advance notice that Swift intends to become a political presence in the future. If so, she could run for president in 2028. By then, she’ll be 39 years old. John F. Kennedy was 43 when he was elected in 1960, making him the youngest elected president in US history.Preposterous as it sounds, remember: In May 2015, Donald Trump was known principally for the NBC television show, The Apprentice, which he had fronted since 2004. He’d made his political views well-known, taking out full page ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post criticizing US foreign policy in 1987. In 1999, Trump briefly explored running for the Reform Party’s nomination for president in the 2000 election, though he withdrew.So when Trump announced his candidacy as a Republican in June 2015, it came as an outrageous surprise. He’d never held political office of any kind. Only one other president had been elected without political experience: Dwight Eisenhower’s background as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War II provided him skills that translated well to the presidency. He served two terms as president, from 1953 to 1961.Eisenhower was a product of a different age in US politics. Trump is very much part of an age when the US struggles with a political bipolarity: Policy vs passion, logic vs emotion, wisdom vs relatability. Politicians are elected as much for celebrity appeal as leadership capability. Voters seem ready to believe they are much the same thing. How otherwise can we explain Trump’s success in 2016?Two years after Trump’s election, Oprah Winfrey seemed poised to turn the 2020 election into a showbusiness extravaganza when she said she was “actively thinking” about running for president. At least, that was the inference from her speech at the Golden Globes. “A new day is on the horizon,” she prophesied. In 2018, Oprah was at her persuasive peak. She was arguably the single most influential person in the world and would have made a formidable contender, despite her political inexperience. Oprah was a rare celebrity, praised for her moral authority, venerated for her inspiration and respected for her support to countless women. She seemed kissed with purpose — her destiny was surely the White House.Trump actually named Oprah as a possible running mate when he was considering putting himself forward with the Reform Party in 1999; it’s doubtful she would have been interested.\\xa0 She settled into a kind of trusted advisor role, dispensing wisdom and assistance without showing any ambition for power. Today, Oprah has lost her momentum, though her coruscating endorsement of Harris was a reminder of her presence. She remains an interested party.Traditional politicians like senators and governors have, in recent years, lost immediacy. They project personae and exude authority in a carefully stylized and practiced manner, using the media in almost the same way Bill Clinton (president\\xa01993–2001) or George W. Bush (president 2001–2009) did.\\xa0By contrast, figures from entertainment know how to make themselves believable. They engage audiences by sharing ostensibly private insights and exchange the experiences that shape or scar them.Swift, like other celebs, makes no attempt to separate her public face from her private life. She surpasses arguably every artist in history in her ability to share personal experiences through her music. Her fans wax about how her music speaks to them personally with insight and vision. Many of her fans are too young to vote now, but not in four years.Some readers will think I’ve stumbled Lewis Carrol-like down a rabbit hole leading to a land of magic and strange logic. I remind them that in 2016, Trump secured 304 electoral votes compared to opponent Hillary Clinton’s 227, winning the presidency. He may yet be re-elected. Swift will not feel intimidated by her lack of political worldliness, sophistication or practical knowledge. After all, Trump had none of these benefits.In 2018, Swift publicly supported Democrats in her home state of Tennessee, causing a surge in voting registrations, especially from young people. It was the first sign of political engagement among her fans. The following year, she spoke out in favor of the Equality Act. In her 2019 music video for “You Need to Calm Down,” she promoted the petition for the act. She was an active supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement as well.So perhaps it makes sense for her to maintain her position on the sidelines and encourage advocates, but without risking what could be a damaging misstep. A-listers like Barbra Streisand and George Clooney have stayed in their own dominion while earnestly making their political preferences heard. This would be Swift’s safest choice. After all, you can have too much of a good thing and no one in history has ever been as ubiquitous, audibly as well as visibly. Could audiences just get sick of her?One of the verities of celebrity culture is that it values change, freshness and novelty. Swift has been on top longer than most. Maybe she recognizes this herself and is already plotting a segue into politics. It’s not exactly a logical move: That would be to sidestep into movies. Not that this is without perils: Madonna crashed as spectacularly as she succeeded in cinema.Celebrity times demand celebrity politicians — or politicians who are prepared to greet Oprah’s “new day” and entertain as much as govern. In showbusiness, Swift has reached Parnassian heights: astral record sales, unsurpassable box office and unbelievable social media followings. Artistically and commercially, she is at her zenith, cleverly integrating critiques of patriarchy into her songs when she conveys how even unmistakably successful women are still liable to run into misogyny.But is it all just too trivial? The state of the world is grim and nothing Swift does will change that\\xa0 right now. But the winds are blowing in her direction: The post-Harvey Weinstein tremors have destabilized patriarchy and the #MeTo movement remains a force. Would Sean Combs have met with instant condemnation and been reassigned as persona non grata were his transgressions known ten years ago? Censured, castigated, deplored, perhaps; but probably not canceled, as he surely will be. The historical privileges of manhood are disappearing.Will Swift feel like culture-hopping from music to politics? It may be a leap too far, but no one can ignore her unstoppable influence. Much, I believe, depends on the outcome of the November election. If Harris wins, Swift will devote more time to championing her, perhaps closing the distance between herself and the Democrats, but not maneuvering into the political mainstream. If Trump wins instead, Swift may take the leap of faith and embrace the impossible, as giddily disturbing as this sounds today. Given modern America’s history, Swift’s leap could be the sanest thing to happen to the US.[Ellis Cashmore is the author of\\xa0The Destruction and Creation of Michael Jackson,\\xa0Elizabeth Taylor and\\xa0Celebrity Culture.][Lee Thompson-Kolar edited this piece.]The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.You must be logged in to post a comment.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCelebrity culture has increasingly influenced the way we view our political leaders, transforming elections into spectacles of personality rather than...\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tActors Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have filed for divorce after years of on-off relationships and breakups.

Yet in this intense election season, Swift has fallen silent on politics, despite several much-hyped endorsements in the past. For the good of all, let’s hope she remains mum.

An endorsement of Harris, a polarizing political figure, could alienate a significant portion of her fan base, undermining the very connection that has made her so successful.

       " 'Taylor Swift is voting for Kamala Harris for president!Swift broke her silence on the 2024 presidential election by endorsing the Democratic candidate on Tuesday, following Harris’ explosive debate with Donald Trump.Alongside a photo of her and her cat Benjamin Button, Taylor wrote on Instagram, “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.”She continued, “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”Swift confirmed, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.”The singer went on to encourage everyone to vote. “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice,” she said. “Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early.”Swift made reference to Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance\\'s 2021 comments as she signed off, “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.”Taylor supported Joe Biden and Harris in the 2020 presidential election.See all the stylish stars at Paris Fashion Week!Get a first look at the women who may be competing for Grant Ellis\\' heart on \"The Bachelor\"!After the Emmys, it was time for the stars to party!Check out all the best moments and star collisions from inside the 2024 Emmys!Check out all the best moments and star collisions from inside the 2024 Emmys!Stars hit the red carpet at the 2024 Emmys.Sign up here for exclusive access to all your favorite celebrities\\n            and breaking entertainment news!\\nPrivacy Policy |\\n          Terms of Use |\\n          Ad Choices\\n          © 2024 Telepictures Productions Inc.

In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes.She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message “Childless Cat Lady.” The remark is a reference to three-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country’s future.A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest.“That was eloquent. And it was clear,” Walz said. “And that’s the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.”Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump’s decision to post artificial intelligence-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said “Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.”Trump’s posts “brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift wrote. She added that “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice.”Trump said Wednesday that Swift’s move “was just a question of time.” He told Fox & Friends that Swift is “a very liberal person” who “seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price in the marketplace.”In 2020, she supported Democrat Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked “the fires of white supremacy and racism.”Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one.AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. That’s the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn.VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55% of Democrats and just 19% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state.Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday’s MTV Video Music Awards. While it’s unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris.The event was shifted a day later to accommodate Tuesday’s debate. MTV has a long history of encouraging voter participation.Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Philadelphia, Linley Sanders in Washington and Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles contributed to this report.',\n",

She has since been vocally supportive of Democratic policies and candidates, often encouraging her supporters to vote and advocating for women’s rights, reproductive health and LGBTQ+ rights.In her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” Swift expressed regret for not speaking up about political causes sooner, telling her father Scott Swift in an emotionally charged scene that she felt the need “to be on the right side of history.”In another scene, she was critical of former President Donald Trump.A faction of Swift’s supporters –- known as Swifties -– have mobilized in the 2024 election cycle, forming a Swifties for Kamala community online shortly following Biden’s exit from the race and his subsequent endorsement of Harris.The group, which Swift is not affiliated with and has thousands of followers on X, raised more than $122K during its two-hour kickoff call in August. Speakers included Sen. Elizabeth Warren and singer Carole King.“We believe Harris-Walz will fight for our rights and the rights of our loved ones, and help make this country safer for everyone,” Carly Long, communications director of Swifties for Kamala, previously told CNN.CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The A-lister made her announcement on September 10 after mounting speculation about if/when she would make an endorsement.In a post on Instagram, Taylor began by talking about the importance of doing your research when choosing a candidate and noting that she made sure to tune into the debate between Harris and Donald Trump.

       " \"A post shared on Facebook claims Coca-Cola will not work with musician Taylor Swift after she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election.\\xa0Verdict: FalseThe post is inaccurate. The claim was originally posted by a satirical website.Fact Check:\\xa0Swift made an Instagram post endorsing Harris and one encouraging her followers to vote, the latter of which drove over 400,000 visitors to vote.gov, according to The Independent. A YouGov poll found that only eight percent of respondents said the endorsement would make them “somewhat” or “much more likely” to vote for her, but a poll shows the majority said they would not be swayed by a celebrity, the outlet reported.A Facebook post claims that Swift’s endorsement of Harris has driven Coca-Cola to “cut ties” with her. It shows an image of Swift alongside a picture of a Coca-Cola billboard.“Coca-Cola Cuts Ties With Taylor Swift Over Harris Endorsement,” the post reads. “‘We Don’t Support Her Endorsement.'”This post is inaccurate, however. The claim was posted by a Facebook account called SpaceX Fanclub in which it has a disclaimer that says “This is Satire post” and includes a satire label on the photo shared. It was\\xa0posted to Esspots as well, where it also shows a satire label. The site has a disclaimer page saying that it “specializes in satire, parody, and humor” and that “nothing on this website is real.”\\xa0There are no credible news reports to corroborate this claim. Swift collaborated with Coca-Cola for a Diet Coke campaign in 2014, according to the brand’s website.

       " 'Taylor Swift has endorsed Kamala Harris for president of the United States in a post on Instagram published minutes after the US presidential debate, saying the Democratic candidate would be the “warrior” to fight for the rights and causes she believes in.“As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can,” Swift wrote on Instagram to her 283 million followers late on Tuesday, adding: “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election”.“I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”In her statement, Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote.Swift also addressed AI-generated images shared by Donald Trump in late August that falsely depicted Swift and her fans endorsing his campaign for president.She said: “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.”Swift said she had watched the US presidential debate between Harris and Trump, and urged her fans to do their research on “the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most”.She signed off “Childless cat lady,” a reference to comments made by Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance. The picture that appeared with the post was of Swift with her cat Benjamin Button, one of three she owns.Speaking in 2021 to the then Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Vance called senior Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too”.A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)The Trump campaign dismissed Swift’s endorsement, with spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt saying: “This is further evidence that the Democrat party has unfortunately become a party of the wealthy elites. There’s many Swifties for Trump out there in America,” Leavitt said.Swift endorsed Democratic candidates in 2018 and Joe Biden in 2020, but until Tuesday was yet to back anyone in 2024.Asked about Swift’s endorsement of Harris on Tuesday, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz said: “I love her songs, but I want to live in a world where liberals make my art and conservatives make my laws and policies.”Some of Swift’s fan base had already started mobilising for Harris. The Swifties for Kamala Coalition officially launched in late August, raising more than $138,000 (€124,904) for the Democratic candidate in a virtual rally featuring Carole King and the senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand.Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, said on MSNBC he was “incredibly grateful” to Swift. “I say that also as a cat owner, a fellow cat owner,” he said, adding that her endorsement took courage, “and that’s the kind of courage we need in America”.In 2012, researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Maryland tried to establish the correlation, if any, between celebrity endorsements and votes. They used Oprah Winfrey’s endorsement of Barack Obama in advance of the 2008 Democrat primary to examine whether it had any effect on the polls.[\\xa0We don’t need to relate to politicians but they do need to know a Taylor Swift songOpens in new window\\xa0]The researchers concluded that Winfrey’s endorsement was worth about a million votes for Obama, who beat his main primary challenger, Hillary Clinton, by about 270,000 votes in the states used in the sample.Swift is a popular figure nationwide; especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55 per cent of voters overall, including 68 per cent of Democrats, said they had a favourable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43 per cent having a favourable opinion and 45 per cent an unfavourable one.Cayce Myers, a professor of public relations at Virginia Tech, said Swift’s endorsement may have an impact on the election because it may encourage younger Gen Z fans to vote.Myers added that while celebrity endorsements do not necessarily translate into meaningful turnout, Swift’s endorsement was going out to a particularly large fan base, and was focused on women’s rights, an issue that favours Democrats. – GuardianSign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more© 2024 The Irish Times DAC',\n",

       " 'Action News Jax NowWASHINGTON — (AP) — Taylor Swift, one of the music industry\\'s biggest stars, endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the presidential debate ended.\"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,\" Swift wrote late Tuesday in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website.Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes.She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message \"Childless Cat Lady.\" The remark is a reference to three-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump\\'s running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country\\'s future.A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest.“That was eloquent. And it was clear,\" Walz said. \"And that’s the kind of courage we need in America to stand up.”Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump\\'s decision to post artificial intelligence-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said \"Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.\"Trump\\'s posts “brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift wrote. She added that \"I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice.\"Trump said Wednesday that Swift\\'s move “was just a question of time.” He told “Fox & Friends” that Swift is “a very liberal person” who “seems to always endorse a Democrat and she\\'ll probably pay a price in the marketplace.”In 2020, she supported Democrat Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked \"the fires of white supremacy and racism.\"Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one.AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. That’s the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn.VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55% of Democrats and just 19% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state.Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday’s MTV Video Music Awards. While it’s unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris.The event was shifted a day later to accommodate Tuesday’s debate. MTV has a long history of encouraging voter participation.___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Philadelphia, Linley Sanders in Washington and Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles contributed to this report.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

       " 'Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president moments after the end of Tuesday night\\'s presidential debate against Donald Trump.The pop star made her announcement in an Instagram post signed as \"Childless Cat Lady\" - a reference to comments by Trump\\'s running mate JD Vance.Her post, breaking her silence on the 2024 vote, explained: \"I\\'m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"Within 24 hours of her announcement, nearly 340,000 people had visited the voter registration website, vote.gov, using a custom link created and shared by Swift.Swift, who also backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020, called Harris a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\".She added: \"I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"Swift\\'s text was accompanied by a photo of her with a cat. Her \"Childless Cat Lady\" comment was a nod to remarks made in 2021 by Vance, who is Trump\\'s candidate for vice-president.Ancient Egypt to Taylor Swift: The historic roots of the \\'cat lady\\'Vance, the Ohio senator, has faced a backlash for a clip in which he called several prominent Democrats - including Harris - \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\". He recently said his comments were \"sarcastic\".Swift went on to compliment Harris\\'s choice of vice-presidential candidate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who she said had been \"been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman\\'s right to her own body for decades\".The singer said she was in part motivated to share her voting decision with the public after an AI image of her falsely endorsing Trump was posted on his website.\"It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\" she said. \"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\"Trump went on to embrace the fake images in a post that sparked a backlash among Swift\\'s fans - or Swifties - who accused Trump of spreading misinformation.In response to Swift\\'s endorsement of Harris, Trump told Fox News that \"was not a Taylor Swift fan.\" He called her a \"very liberal person\" and said that she will \"pay the price for it in the marketplace.\"ANALYSIS: Who won the Harris-Trump debate?WATCH: Key moments from presidential debateLIVE: Kamala Harris puts Donald Trump on defensiveVERIFY: Eating pets, inflation, abortion - claims fact-checkedTRACKER: Who is winning US election polls, Trump or Harris?Trump supporter Elon Musk, known to be the father of 12 children, posted on his social-media platform X (formerly Twitter): \"Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.\"Meanwhile, Harris\\'s running mate Walz told MSNBC on Tuesday night after learning about the endorsement he was grateful to Swift \"as a fellow cat owner.\"Swift is one of several celebrities to endorse Harris, including singers John Legend and Olivia Rodrigo, actor George Clooney and director Spike Lee.Meanwhile, former wrestler Hulk Hogan, TV star Amber Rose and billionaire Elon Musk have endorsed Trump.Swift\\'s intervention came after a fiery 90-minute presidential debate, during which the two candidates sparred over issues such as abortion rights, the economy and immigration.It is not the first time the pop star has endorsed the Democratic nominee in a race against Trump. Swift announced her support for President Joe Biden and Harris as his vice-president a month before the 2020 election.Swift was also a vocal critic of Trump during his presidency surrounding the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd.\"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?\" she posted on Twitter/X. \"We will vote you out in November.\"This video can not be playedWatch highlights from Trump-Harris clashNoting Swift\\'s political past, one academic who studies the intersection of media and politics suggested that the endorsement was unlikely to move the needle in Harris\\'s favour.\"No surprise at all, she endorsed Biden and Harris in 2020 so we already knew her politics,\" said Lauren Rosewarne, a University of Melbourne professor.Swift\\'s endorsement could impact voter registration, Ms Rosewarne told the BBC. But because her fan-base skews young and female - and that is already the Harris supporter base - her endorsement may not have a big impact come November. The singer has 283 million followers on Instagram. Her endorsement has received more than 4.5 million likes on Instagram less than three hours after she posted it.In her post, Swift urged first-time voters to register and said she would post a link with more voting information on her page.\"I\\'ve done my research, and I\\'ve made my choice,\" she said. \"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\"13 Times Taylor Swift Made HistorySIMPLE GUIDE: Everything you need to know about the voteEXPLAINER: Seven swing states that could decide electionFACT CHECK: Was US economy stronger under Biden or Trump?IMMIGRATION: Could Trump really deport a million migrants?North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.
